SpellCraft Starter Kit by hgilman, originally by the Aor Minecraft Devteam

The spells contained in this plugin will be incorporated into SpellCraft at release. They are kept
here to test the functionality of the SpellCraft API, as well as to keep devlopment of cool spells
separate from the development of a robust API.

When SpellCraft 1.0 is released, there will be a config file allowing admins to choose whether or
not they want these spells included. If no other SpellCraft plugins are found on the server, they
will enable automatically.

This plugin will also be used as an example to familiarize new programmers with the SpellCraft API.
